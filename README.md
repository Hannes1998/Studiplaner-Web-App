## Studiplaner

We developed a website for students at HAW designed to make planning and organizing their academic life easier.
It features individual accounts with calendars to record important dates such as assignment deadlines, exams, and personal notes. The calendar is structured with both monthly and weekly views. Our focus is on intuitive and natural usability, combined with thoughtful design, to ensure a pleasant user experience.

For more information please refer to the documentation PDF.

## Technologies:

XAMPP: We use XAMPP to develop and test our PHP-based web applications locally.

Mailgun: We utilize Mailgun as an external, free mail server to programmatically send dynamically generated emails, for example, when users request a password reset.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are the three core languages of modern web development.

PHP: Our project requires the generation and processing of dynamic content based on user input and database queries. PHP is ideal for this, as it enables server-side handling of user data.
